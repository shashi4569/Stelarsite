    <p><em>Shashi</em> is speaking to the world that there is no recognition for talent and work.
    Unfortunately the system is still working in favour of lucky people. If this continues to grow
    to grow in coming years then the development of society will stagnate. I'm telling you that this
   will lead the people to find looop holes in system to become successfull in their life.
    <b>STOP THIS</b> of everyone will pay sometime</p>
